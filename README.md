My 24 Week Coding Journal

## Week One

Okay, so I'm not sure how I'm going to go doing this full stack dev course.
I've always forked other peoples code and patched it together with the help of tutors and friends.
Yet, I've got a burning desire to be able to build my own things rather than rely on other coders.

In my minds eye I'm this slick super-spy hacking the planet.
In reality I'm pulling my hair out updating my OS and apps.

So, I'm hoping this course helps rectify these psychhological incongruencies.

Much love,
Miss Monad
